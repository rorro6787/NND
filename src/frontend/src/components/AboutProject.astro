    This is the <strong>MRI Brain Disease Detection</strong> System. The <strong>Final Degree Project (TFG)</strong> will consist of the design and development of an advanced system for medical image analysis, focused on detecting brain pathologies in patients using <strong>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> scans. The main objective of the system is to provide healthcare professionals with an effective tool to accurately and quickly identify and classify brain lesions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The implementation will involve an algorithm that utilizes the <strong>YOLOv8 model</strong> trained with the dataset defined in this link. Each data point in the dataset will be a <strong>three-dimensional image</strong>, with a <strong>.nii extension</strong>, which are the files used in the sector and require specialized software like <strong>3D Slicer</strong> to manipulate and extract information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each plane of a set of <strong>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> scans will be analyzed. This algorithm will be specifically trained to work with <strong>2D images</strong> that are extracted from <strong>three-dimensional (3D) representations</strong>. Its goal is to automatically detect lesions in these images. Once the lesions are identified, the algorithm will generate <strong>2D bounding boxes</strong> that represent the intersections between the 3D images and the analyzed planes. These boxes will help visualize the exact location of the lesions in the MRI scans.
