Neuro Disease Detector
======================

The `neuro_disease_detector` will consist of the design and development of an advanced system for medical image analysis, focused on detecting brain pathologies in patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The main objective of the system is to provide healthcare professionals with an effective tool to accurately and quickly identify and classify brain lesions.

Installation

To install the project, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You will need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. Before installing the project, we recommend creating a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the project dependencies using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install neuro-disease-detector

.. toctree::
